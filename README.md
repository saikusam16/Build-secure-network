As we all know, the internet is a very risky place, with todayâ€™s
technological advancements it is very easy to steal data and
information. Intruders can snoop, spoof and steal information that
is transmitted through the internet. So it is very essential to secure
our information before transmitting it . Our problem statement is to
build secure network applications with SSL(Secure Socket Layer).
SSL is a protocol for establishing authenticated and encrypted
links or connections between networked computers.SSL works by
binding the identities of entities such as websites and companies
to cryptographic key pairs via digital documents known as X.509
certificates. Each key pair consists of a private key and a public
key. The private key is kept secure, and the public key can be
widely distributed via a certificate. There is a special
mathematical relationship between the private and public keys in
a pair that it is possible to use the public key to encrypt a
message, that can only be decrypted with the private key.
